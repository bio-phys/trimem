Welcome to trimem's documentation
=================================

**Trimem** is a python package for the Monte Carlo simulation of lipid
membranes according to the Helfrich theory [Helfrich1973]_.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

Trimem can be installed via

.. code-block:: Bash

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bio-phys/trimem.git
   pip install trimem/

We suggest the installation using the ``--user`` flag to ``pip``. Alternatively,
we recommend to consider the usage of virtual environments to isolate the
installation of trimem, see, e.g., `here`_.

.. _here: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trimem builds upon the generic mesh data structure
`OpenMesh <https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/openmesh/>`_, which
is included as a submodule that is pulled in upon ``git clone`` via the
``--recurse-submodules`` flag, see :ref:`installation`.

For the efficient utilization of shared-memory parallelism, trimem makes
use of the `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ application programming model
(``>= v4.5``) and modern ``C++``. It thus requires relatively up-to-date
compilers (supporting at least ``C++17``).

If not already available, the following python dependencies will be
automatically installed:

* numpy
* scipy
* h5py
* meshio

Documentation and tests further require:

* autograd
* meshzoo
* sphinx
* sphinx-copybutton
* sphinxcontrib-programoutput

Usage
-----

**Trimem** provides a convenient user interface via a :ref:`cli` that is
available after :ref:`installation` as ``mc_app`` under the respective binary
installation directory available to ``pip``. For a quick-start and more
detailed documentation, please have a look at the :ref:`usage`.

Alternatively, trimem can also be used as a
:ref:`python library <python-module>`. High level functionality is exposed in
the module :mod:`trimem.mc.util`. For details on low level functionality,
please refer to the :ref:`API reference <modules>`.
